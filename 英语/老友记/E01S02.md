|           | [Scene Central Perk, everyone's there.                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |                                                                                                                         |

| Monica:   | What you guys don't understand is, <br>for us, kissing is as important as any part of it.                                                                                                                                                                     | 你们男生不懂亲吻对女生的重要性，<br>对我们而言，亲吻和其他任何部分一样重要                                              |
| Joey:     | Yeah, right...Y'serious?                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      | 没错，当真?                                                                                                             |
| Phoebe:   | Oh, yeah!                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
| Monica:   | Absolutely.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   | 没错                                                                                                                    |
| Chandler: | Yeah, I think for us, <br>kissing is pretty much like an opening act, y'know? <br>I mean it's like the stand-up comedian you have to sit through before Pink Floyd comes out.                                                                                 | 对我们而言<br>亲吻就像是开场，就像佛洛伊飞船出场前，你得耐着性子先看完脱口秀                                            |
| Ross:     | Yeah, and-and it's not that we don't like the comedian; it's that-that... <br>that's not why we bought the ticket.                                                                                                                                            | 对，我们并非讨厌脱口秀，只是那不是我们买票的原因                                                                        |
| Chandler: | The problem is, though, after the concert's over, <br>**no matter how great the show was**, <br>you girls are always looking for the comedian again, y'know? <br>I mean, we're in the car, we're fighting traffic... <br>basically just trying to stay awake. | 问题出在于演唱会结束后 **不论表演有多精彩**，你们女生总还想再看脱口秀，我们在车上奋力杀出车阵，<br>只是拼命让自己别睡着 |
| Rachel:   | Yeah, well, word of advice: Bring back the comedian. <br>Otherwise next time you're gonna find yourself sitting at home, listening to that album alone.                                                                                                       | 是哦?给你一个建议 叫脱口秀主持人再度上场，<br>否则下次，你们只能坐家里听唱片                                            |
| Joey:     | (pause)....Are we still talking about sex?                                                                                                                                                                                                                    | 我们还在谈论性吗?                                                                                                       |

| Marsha: | He's out banging other women over the head with a club, while she sits at home trying to get the mastodon smell out of the carpet!             | 他尝试和“参与者先生”生活在一起，他在外头乱搞女人，而她却待家里设法去除地毯上乳齿象的味道 |
| Ross:   | Marsha, these are cave people. Okay? They have issues like 'Gee, that glacier's getting kinda close.' See?                                     | 玛莎，他们是穴居人，他们关心的问题是Gee，那条冰河愈来愈接近了                            |
